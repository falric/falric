### About

The web keeps developing, promoting new technologies and social change. It affects how we interact and how we live our lives. I want to play an active part in that development and help find solutions for old and new challenges.

Curiosity has always played a part in my career. I seek out opportunities to learn new things or deepen my knowledge.
